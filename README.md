# Prey-Predator-Simulation

Project completed during my third year of Licence.

## Package installation

You first need to install the devtools package, it can be done easily from Rstudio. We install the package from Github (remove the # sign):

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("GomesLucie/Prey-Predator-Simulation")  
library(Prey-Predator-Simulation)
```
